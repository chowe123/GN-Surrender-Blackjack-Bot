Run from BlackjackGUI.py
Make your game maximized, small numbers probably makes the OCR worse, I didn't run full-screen
Place your initial bet manually and click deal, script only clicks on rebet
Will probably not work on smaller monitors/laptops

Change dynamicDealer to 1 to use searching function to find dealer box (draw larger dealerBBox)
0 to use static dealer box (draw as small as possible around total)


    F8 to start/stop script
    ESC to exit script
    Set dealer bounding box to the black square of the dealers score, see images in Captured_Cards/dealer
    Set playerTable bounding box to the entire player area, anywhere the golden player total can appear
    Set buttonBbox to box containing all buttons (Rebet, Stand, Hit, Double, Split, Surrender)

    
    Order of Strategy:
        Check if split is optimal -> Check if surrender is optimal -> If surrender is optimal but not available click it anyways -> Check if soft total -> Check if hard total
